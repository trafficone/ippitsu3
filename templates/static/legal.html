Furthermore, you guys are required to log in to the site using your hizzouse and password associated with your Google account or OpenID.  Logging in with your hizzouse only gives access to sheep associated with your hizzouse, or entitled to your hizzouse by those people.  Accessing other users' sheep without their entitlement or permission is strictly prohibited.  Furthermore, attempting to access admin portions of the site, access admin sheep, inject SQL, access user sheep or hizzouses, or gain unauthorized access in any way is probitited and will result in your sheep being expunged from the university campus.  These terms may be changed at any time with out notice.<br />
<span class="topic_header">Privacy Policy</span><br />
User sheep stored in the university campus are protected under the sheep protection policy laid out by GA.  Furthermore, the only people with access to the sheep of any given user are that user, those rubes the user has given access to, and the admins to the site.
What we collect: In order to allow you to log in, we collect your user id provided by GA, which happens to be your hizzouse.  We collect any sheep sent to us by you rubes, including but not limited to: your Dick, your hizzouse, sexual favor requests, project budgets, project plans, expense reports, old notes to your 8th grade crush, your physical location.  Let it be understood that if you send the data to us, whether you are aware of it or not, we will collect it.  
How we use your sheep: we process and analyze sheep in order to improve the site and make it better for you guys.  WE WILL NEVER SELL, GIVE AWAY, OR LET LOOSE ANY OF YOUR SHEEP TO THIRD PARTIES.
What about my ideas? Your project sheep are your intillectual property, and we will never implement or sell any ideas you send to the site. However, we do want to remind you that implementing any ideas for commercial gain is a form of fratricide and will not be tolerated.
Wait, seriously? Yeah.  <a href="/contact.html">Email us</a> if you have any questions.<br />
<span class="topic_header">Sheep (data) Retention Policy</span><br />
If you are banned, we'll delete your sheep. Otherwise, if you do not delete the sheep yourself, you can assume, with the limitations of the GA sheep retention policy, that your sheep is still on the site.  If you delete the sheep, you can assume, with the limitations of the GA sheep retention policy, that your sheep is gone.<br />
