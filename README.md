# Ippitsu 3 
## The Online Project Tracker for Google Appengine

This application, running at ippitsu2.appspot.com, allows you to easily track:
* your projects
* project steps
* per-project budgets and expenses
* blocking items that keep you from finishing

Additionally, you can (read: will) record retrospectives for every project you finish or abandon.  That way you can learn from your successes and mistakes easily, 
and track your progress in project management.

# Goals

I wrote this application specifically to help myself complete personal projects, and track my progress.
It is very difficult to progress in a large personal project with many facets, and you quickly lose sight of some goals.
This tool is designed to answer the following questions:

* What am I doing?
* How much have I spent on this? 
* How much more do I need to spend on this?
* What tasks need to be completed to finish this project?
* What items are preventing completion?
* What are my options about those items?
* How do I know this project is complete?

For small projects, the answers to these questions might seem intuitively obvious, but once you're working on something with some 
serious size, the capacity to answer all these questions with certainty deminishes pretty rapidly.

# Comparison with Other Tools

There are a lot of tools out there to help with project management, but they're typically geared toward the Agile development 
methodology.  Personal projects are potentially Agile, but you end up generating a lot of extra work for yourself to keep track of
every little sub-task you're hitting on, and you don't necessarily have sprints in personal projects either.  All-in-all, they're 
too much work for too little reward.  Stick to Ippitsu 3 for personal projects.

# Ongoing Projects

This tool is designed to get your from point A to point B.  It works best when your project has completion criteria.  Releasing the software, moving out, 
passing the class, finishing the dress, etc. are all good examples.  However, for ongoing projects, such as software in active development, or a daily 
comic strip, the tool has more limited practicality.  For example, the budget is finite and the project is indefinite.

To remedy this, it might be best to treat each milestone as a project, such as a version release, or a full story arc.

# New Features

I plan on adding to the functionality of ippitsu 3 over time, the following features I would like to add (in no particular order):
* Collaboration tools - Share your projects with others and let them work on it too
* Charts and Graphs - Watch your projects turn from mystical plans into reality
* Gantt Charts - Like the professionals use
* Project Management Training - Just a collection of documents on project management.
* User Notifications - Recieve an email when your deadlines are coming up
* User Log - Track what you're working on and share it with others.
* Repo Linking - Connect a software repository with your project, tie commits to steps
* Project Idea Repository - Got a project idea, but not enough experience to start it? Share it with others.
* Project Graveyard - Didn't finish a project? Maybe you can pass what you learned on to others.
* AJAX Validation - Validate inserts/updates before you click 'save'

This list is more like a wishlist of stuff I'd like to see.  I probably won't complete all of these features, but if there's a feature you'd like to see, 
the fastest way to get it implemented it is to fork the code and implement it yourself.
